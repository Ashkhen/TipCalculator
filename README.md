## TipCalculator

- Wrote basic logic to calculate tip and total amounts based on amount entered by user. 

- Added a Karma Bank feature to reward karma points based on chosen tip percentage; ensured button is only activated when there is a valid dollor value, and is disabel until next dolloar amount is entered.

- Added animation to karama points label.

Approximate time spent: **7 hours**
